You work in marketing and you have heard about the powerful impact of storytelling on your business growth. You watched a couple of videos and downloaded an e-book on building stories for brands. It seems to be so easy to implement this strategy in your content creation. And still, something is missing, something is not working out.

You know that there are various ways to tell a story. You also know about the Hero's journey structure. What if I tell you there are [many more][0]? 

Learning the notions, watching tutorials and scrolling through the infographics won't help you figure out the basic strategy for your business unless you understand the who-is-who on the storytelling.

Who is the hero of your legend? Is it the company that solves the world problems and creates the brighter future? Is it you, the people behind it? Is it your product?  
The true hero of your story must be the client, the reader.

Storytelling has an aim to impact people through a compelling tale, that would provoke emotions and build the connection. Like in all kinds of marketing, the goal of storytelling is to influence and inform. The difference between the pure "selling" and creating stories around the brand is in the value that storytelling gives to the readers and the way it resonates with them.

How can you use it in your content creation strategy, concretely?  
For example, you can follow these steps:

- Show the world they are living in now, the struggle they have;

- Then move to the opportunity to have a painless life, a future where the problem is elegantly solved;

- Show the transformation they will go through and how it will change them;

- Go back to the now and point out what is not working with the current situation;

- Move back to the bright future and introduce your solution.

You can play with the techniques and invent your own ones. It can be used while creating content like articles and videos, as well as in your sales pitch and even head hunting process.

Creating compelling stories that are remarkable and memorable is hard but it's worth the effort. The emotional bond that they set between your brand and the users is the strongest advantage you can have on the market.

Build your strategy basing on this main point and you will figure out the way it works best for you.
