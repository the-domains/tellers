# **We are used to giving up**

The idea of this article came to me after I bought a ukulele. It has always been my dream and now I have it! What happened next is easy to recall: I was extremely happy to start playing but after two weeks I abandoned it completely.

I should put a disclaimer, I guess. I don't pretend to be a great psychologist or a popular life coach (not yet). Those are my opinions on how things work for me. And, they may correspond to your life too.

  
_We are used to giving up._ When bad things follow good things we think that we chose the wrong path. The first difficulties make us lose inspiration, enthusiasm and goodwill.

It happens with literally everything. New job or a project, relationships, hobbies and attempts to make our life better (like diets, resolutions or habits we want to have). And playing some instrument, of course.

There are actually various stages of our dealing with the thing. The first step: We are in love. Nothing has ever been better than this, how could I live without it before, life is wonderful and I'm going to be famous/skinny/best-partner-on-Earth. We can do everything and we want to. Our inspiration gives us incredible strength. This period is a huge trampoline and we think that we are changing strongly. And, we are, probably. Many good things can happen to us and it's magical.

After that comes phase two: disappointment. It's strong and painful, and it's devastating after such a great period like we've just had. Our partner appears to be annoying and dull, our job requires much more effort than before and the diet just can't live long with all these birthday parties.

Many people give up here. The thought is that it shouldn't be so hard because if it is right for me, I would continue no matter what. And we want to finish the relationship,  sabotage our projects and dreams. But this is the exact "no matter what". This is that milestone which determines whether we are successful in things. If we force ourselves to "keep swimming" and banally not to give up we will get to the phase three.

I call it reinspiration. We understood how the things work and we can fight with ourselves when we are melancholic. Of course, it does not prevent us from returning to the phase two. Actually, this is going to happen again, and again, and again. But now we know that it is not the end of the world, and each time we will be more inspired.

We should understand that periods of frustration and devastation are normal, even good. They are a part of the process, of our path.

Believe it or not, now things seem easier for me once I see it clearer. Now it's up to me what to do with facts and circumstances that happen and change. And it is a part of that ephemeral control we want to have over our lives. We in Wander Hackers believe that next year will be great for you and all the projects you have in your mind will come to a success. So, take somewhere nice your partner, go back to playing piano and take out your French textbook!
