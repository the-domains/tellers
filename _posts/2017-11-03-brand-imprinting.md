Brand Imprinting

Do you have a favourite shop you always buy your bread at? Or a hairdresser that was like love at the first sight?

This is a phenomenon I would like to call[][0]**[brand imprinting][0].**

Imprinting per se is "loving something because it corresponds to our previously experienced beliefs". In marketing it relates to the following: users generally prefer systems similar to those they learned on and dislike unfamiliar systems. In the less fluffy words: I love to buy my cappuccino in Starbucks because i tried a cappuccino for the first time in Starbucks and every other coffeeshop makes a much worse cappuccino than Starbucks does, and it's not necessary to even go to other shops to know it.

For example, I'm always buying my olives and dried fruits at one vendor on the Sunday market. I don't even want to go to the others because I'm already satisfied and comfortable with this one. And when I offer some dry fruits to my colleagues, I will always mention how satisfied I am with that vendor.  
Or, I've been buying my clothes in H&M because the very first perfectly fitting pair of jeans was found there (hands up [\#tallgirls ][1]knowing the trouble of dressing long legs ðŸ™‹). Of course, it was told to many people many times.  
**What does it mean for brands?**  
It's crucial to invest in your customer experience and make sure the first interaction with your brand is smooth, pleasurable and fun because then it is very simple that some sensitive and easy-to-impress guys like me become your lifelong ambassadors.
