# **Where is the fastest internet?**

Internet becomes one of the main commodities in the modern society. We can't work without it, we can't study without it, our social life is greatly influenced by our connection to the web. 

Some people do not even know how to occupy themselves in case of not properly working internet. And for those who pay their living by means of network fast and uninterrupted connection is on the top of the priorities. Especially if you switch cities, countries or continents.

We have collected some information about the fastest internet countries to help you choose your eventual new destination.

Google, Wikipedia and different online publishers base their research on this matter on Akamai Technologies "State of the Internet" report. According to the recent version, South Korea performs "the fastest average download data" of 23 Mbit/s. You can see how greatly different it is from the second fast internet contestant, Hong Kong, which being a Special Administrative Region of China, performs the connection of 16,3 Mbit/s. Interestingly, the connection speed in the whole country of China is of 3,8 Mbit/s and brings it only to the 41st place in the rank.

The next countries to provide the fastest Internet are: Japan (with 15,0 Mbit/s), Switzerland (14,5 Mbit/s), Sweden (14,1 Mbit/s), Netherlands (14,0 Mbit/s) and Ireland (13,9 Mbit/s). The last places of the 10 countries with the most powerful connection are Latvia (13,0 Mbit/s), Czech Republic (12,3 Mbit/s) and Singapore (12,2 Mbit/s). The last country of the rank is Bolivia with the speed of connection of 1,1 Mbit/s.  
As we see, Akamai Technologies do not publish the rating for all countries. And it also makes us see that South Korea is fairly a stable winner due to their network access systems develop much each year. About 92,4% of the population are active internet users. The importance of the high broadband penetration is related to a ubiquitous consume of electronic devices.  
The following countries are as competitive. The governments strongly protect Freedom of expression and respect these rights. There is wifi on the streets in the metro and on the trains.

As we saw, many countries are up-to-date with the technical and digital revolution of our society. I suppose, many of you would like to explore those places as your new working country apart from their high quality and fast Internet, so this new information may be helpful.

As soon as the new ratings are published, we will provide you with new data on the matter.
