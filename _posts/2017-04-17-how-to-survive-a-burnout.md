# **How to survive a burnout?**

You are a hard worker. Probably, even a workaholic. You can come back home from the office, open your laptop, sit and understand in half an hour that you are still wearing your coat. And only because your partner says you are.

You feel tired every day, sometimes you feel less accomplished as usual, and you may feel powerless. But at some point you see it differently: apathy, simple tasks are suddenly unbearable, even the activities you enjoyed are now dull and stressful. It is not better after a day off which brings you to a conclusion: you've been burned out.

**First of all**, you should underline in your agenda that coming back to normal will take some time. It has been something bothering you for long to cause a burnout. 

**Second**, be with your family, friends, your dog or your gym mates. People who understand your feelings and surround you with their support are the best cure of all times.

**Third**, reschedule your activities. Add more walking in the park, put less working hours, less cigarettes and sitting in the office. It may cause you some delays, so plan carefully. And remember: if you continue pushing yourself towards the deadline it won't do, it will be just worse, so you DESERVE the rest, do not feel guilty for your soul sickness.

**Fourth**, put the imaginary wall between you and outter world negativity. Should it be explained?

**Fifth**, laugh, sing, dance, do what makes you feel stupid or funny. It does not matter, nobody is watching, and this will definitely burst your mood and creativity.

**Sixth**, eat colorful food, which is mostly fruit and vegetables, and not jelly beans and Skittles.

Vitamins are essential for you not only now when you need to recover, so put is in your to-eat list daily.

**Seventh**, listen to music. My own tip is to lie down on the couch or bed, close your eyes and play your favorite music through the headphones. Ten minutes and you are efficient again. Also, consider listening to Mozart's music: it's therapeutical effect was proved by many scientists.

And **eight**, rethink all your working activity. You just understood that this rhythm was bad for you. So, you are planning to change it and dedicate more time to your health.
