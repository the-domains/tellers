# **In a break between the flights**

Meet [Natalia][0], a Ukrainian dancer who travels the world together with her show group. Today she is going to introduce us to such a splendid country as China.

_Thank you for this interview. First, tell our readers, what made you come to China, what is your little story behind this travel?_

My little yet very valuable story started from a call that changed my life in a single instance. I have got the offer to do what I love while traveling. I already agreed in my head, without yet saying that definite "yes". My dream to return on stage came true in that same moment. Going abroad appeared to be a piece of cake. It used to be something unreal, unreachable for me, but here we are on the plane and landing in Hong Kong. Just some preliminary efforts and we are in China! My work was a real pleasure. There were sleepless nights, new places, long flights and heavy luggage that we had to bring everywhere. All this is perfect to make you hardy. It is a great experience that gives you power, despite the difficulties. Because if you do what you love, it is not even a job as we consider it. My job is a show. We made a tour across fifty Chinese cities; our strong female squad that experienced all good and bad of China, consists of a singer and two dancers. It is still difficult for me to believe that during these five months we had flown for 26 times and seen the most amazing cities of the country. It is a big accomplishment!

### _What was the biggest surprise for you during the first days or weeks?_

My feelings about China were all very diverse, it is definitely a country of contrasts! Here are some particular ones. The very first impression was "Where is the air and the sky?" (Laughing). You have probably heard about air pollution and heavy showers in China. But during the summer it is a bit contrasting - the air is still, almost no wind, heat, but you get used to it pretty fast. We also were impressed by the food. You can't expect cheeses, butter, sausages in this country, they are only in big cities and if you are ready to pay much money. This is what we found a bit tough, but I really enjoyed the national cuisine. There are lots of cheap fruits and seafood. The Chinese have this little oddity - they don't use the number 4! They don't celebrate birthdays if they fall on this date, they don't use it in naming the floors, the cellphone numbers containing the 4 cost twice as cheap. These people also impressed us by their excessive interest towards the foreigners, for them we were an example to follow, in terms of beauty, as it seemed. Be ready that they will watch you and take pictures, especially in the province. It really bursts your mood. Chinese people can be noisy and not polite according to our standards. But around 4 a.m. all the rubbish on the streets magically disappears and it is the right time to enjoy the clean views of the country. We were surely surprised by the nature of this country, above all the mountains and green plantations.

### _How is the life in China, according to you?_

The work does not finish when it is finally evening there. All the streets "wake up" around 10 p.m. and the life is seething. These people live while working, they are like those hardworking bees. Another observation was that during the summer you can normally see the cockroaches, despite the cleanliness of the inhabitants. Also, I saw that the Chinese use such means of transport as motorbikes, motorcycles and taxi. But Chinese taxi are not only yellow cabs but also motorbikes, motorcycles and bicycles with a coach! It is simply great, this means is a big pleasure especially for tourists and it helps you surf fast through the traffic jam. Interestingly, you can pass by a whole family of five or six on a motorbike, including some pet. Can you imagine? All of them on one motorbike... (laughing)

### _What was your experience with the cost of life there (food, rent, entertainment)?_

Everybody has different things to say on this matter. According to my experience, food in China and national food is very cheap, you can pay around 30 iuans (4,2 euro) and eat like a king. Prices for the transported food, in the restaurants and supermarkets are higher, of course, as well as in every other country, but the markets are open to all. Chinese people like to chaffer and huckster with the foreigners, so don't be afraid to bargain and leave if you don't like the price - in major cases they will overtake you and give you the goods for the price you suggested. I did not rent an apartment there, our agents paid our staying in hotels, for we not have stayed in a specific city for more than a week, but I took a look at the reception information and you can have a very decent room for two for only 100-200 iuans per night. The entertainment and various sightseeing is cheap and easy to find. You will pay around 50 iuans for a ticket to the Forbidden City or Great Wall of China. The night life in China, clubs with free entrance, small street bistrots are hospitable and absolutely not pricy.

### _What can you tell about the technology there, internet?_

There are difficulties with the internet and its speed in this country, it is not very great news for those who come here. Google, YouTube and Instagram don't work here at all. They are actually forbidden in China, the majority of the inhabitants don't know they exist. But there are many special applications that not all know about, like Seed4me that help you visit these websites as if from other states, like Singapore. They also have a YouTube analogue, Youku, and a website Wechat, which is similar to Instagram, Messenger and voicemail altogether. There is also a website Taobao where you can buy everything, from buckwheat to clothes. There are no problems with mobile Internet, Chinese simcards provide you 3G Internet, and they are sold everywhere on the streets.

### _What would you advise those who plan to come to China for a long period?_

I would advise all who want to visit this country to be ready for very unexpected things and reactions and be amused by Chinese nation. Don't forget the main medicines. Be always prepared. Learn some useful phrases to be able to ask for directions, price, and learn the phrase "Not spicy!", for their national food is very specific and they don't really speak English. And I would like to add that we are the world citizens, we are not divided by our countries. We can do whatever we dream of and live wherever we want.
