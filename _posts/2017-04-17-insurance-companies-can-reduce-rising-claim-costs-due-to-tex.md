# Insurance companies can reduce rising claim costs due to texting while driving

## Distracted driving is on insurer's radar

The risk of having a car crash**[raises by 23% when a driver is handling the cell phone behind the wheel][0]. **Nevertheless, **[according to statistics][1]** 37% of motorists can't refrain from doing so. One of the main reasons is that people are addicted to use and consult their smartphones also while driving.

If you are in charge of managing risks related to car crashes in your business, this data must be keeping you awake at night.

##### Insurers face rising costs as claims due to texting and driving, related claims process costs and even installing expensive monitoring hardware keep increasing.

The good news is that there are ways to tackle the underlying problem of texting while driving and that drivers can be influenced to change their behaviour. There are 3 ways to do so.

### **Sensibilization**

A first approach is to sensibilize drivers and make them understand that their behaviour is dangerous, not only for themselves but also for other road users. Poster campaigns, educational programmes, workshops, flyers, etc. are tools companies can use to raise awareness among their employees.

Despite these efforts, people are still free to choose whether they handle their smartphone behind the wheel.

### **Behavioural change**

A second approach to change drivers' behaviour is sensibilisation combined with a tool that warns drivers of the dangers linked to texting behind the wheel. A company could consider implementing a technology solution which gives the driver direct feedback (positively and negatively) on his behaviour. Safe driving behaviour leads to a positive reward (for instance an increased score) while distracted driving notifies you about your behavior and negatively affects your score. The study by Jan Kubanek **["Reward and punishment act as distinct factors in guiding behaviour"][2]** prove that rewarding mechanisms stimulate the brain to learn faster and effectively adopt gained knowledge.

The advantage is that a driver is rewarded in case he/she drives carefully. The disadvantage is that the phone can still be used by the driver if he/she wants it.

### **Restriction**

Finally, there are tools that block the phone, for instance, by jamming the signal. This approach can be frustrating for drivers spending the working day in car or even dangerous in case of an accident when the cell phone is needed.

Complete restriction and inability to connect create a stressful environment that leads to anxiety and irritability, **[according to the American Psychology Association][3]**[.][3]

As a result, the disadvantage of, for example jamming the signal is an increased level of frustration each time the restriction is faced.

## **Why you should aim at changing behaviour?**

Whereas sensibilizing is a good start, impact will be limited. As it will be for trying to restrict behaviour entirely, which is difficult to adopt and maintain because of frustration and opt-out levels.

The highest success rate you will get with a behavioral change approach that combines reward and penalty. This solution needs to:

1. Have a usage-based approach;
2. Provide accurate data;
3. Follow the action immediately.

Implementing such a system in a cost-efficient way will improve the fleet safety and decrease the fleet cost.
