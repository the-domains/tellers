# **Life alla bolognese**

I've got a long-cherished idea to show how it is to live in Bologna, one of the most liberal, multicultural city, with thousands of students and plenty of activities every day. 

It seems to be a perfect city for anyone: big but not too big, international but not too much, with many events every day but that remains still cozy and charming. Situated on the north of Italy, Bologna is rich and beautiful with its architecture, music, food, concerts, students everywhere - you will not regret visiting it or living here.

It's also true that Bologna can be messy and dirty due to all these people around. But it is not necessarily bad - this free spirit bursts on the university walls, in the streets, in people's minds.

What can be a problem for very organized individuals is the public transport. A bus being late for 5 minutes is not a crime, it often happens also not to find a bus coming at all, so you need to wait for another 20 minutes. Be ready for this possibility, it is a part of Italian mentality, and you can do nothing with this, just understand.

If you really need to work, be sure not to find places like workshop café or shared workspace, they are not here. But there are many comfortable libraries and bars. And internet in Italy can be slow, that is another thing to deal with here.

I would say that food compensates all the flaws completely. So many delicious things make you forget all your business, and I even find it useless to discuss something like Italian cuisine!

There is a great number of events in Bologna, especially on the weekends, when the central streets like Via Indipendenza, Via Rizzoli and Via Ugo Bassi are closed so people gather in mobs and move around, creating nice mood of freedom and holidays. 

If you want to find your liberty or you forgot how it is to be an open-minded student, come to Bologna and let it embrace you.
