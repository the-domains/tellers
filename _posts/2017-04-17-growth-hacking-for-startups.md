# **Growth hacking for startups**

Marketing is evolving at the speed of light: no longer we only print flyers and post product pictures on Facebook.

In order to catch consumers' attention and sell our technology, we need to apply some **growth hacking**. Behind these loud words stands "the process of rapid experimentation across marketing channels and product development to identify the most effective, **efficient ways to grow a business**".

Where is such a fast growth requested on the daily basis? That's right, **startups** is the right place to learn about this new vision on customer acquisition.

What are the tricks that startupers implement and see the (almost) immediate results?

### **HACK THEM**

* Define your **voice**, even if you are a B2B business - see the example of [Powpownow][0].
* **Be bold** - remember what [Airbnb did with Craigslist][1]? You can also set an Adwords campaign with your competitors' keywords, mentioning that you are "alternative to" or "better than" them.
* Send **goodies** - bombard the prospects with fun or useful stuff in their mailbox. Send them postcards, offer samples of branded tea. Have fun!
* Learn about **guerrilla marketing** and principles of **word-of-mouth** - these are the cheapest way to attract your prospects' attention.
* Provide **exceptional customer service**. This must be the strongest point of your business.
* Sign up for **Hubspot's Marketing and Sales newsletter** for a daily boost of inspiration, read Growth Hackers' articles, follow marketing gurus like **Seth Godin**, **Larry Kim, Shane Show **and**Neil Patel**.

### **GO SOCIAL**

* On social media be open, friendly, keep up to your strategy and voice, answer all messages and comments.
* Write **themed content** and tag the relevant people and companies on Twitter with the link to the article.
* **Twitter** - use [Tweepi][2] to monitor followers and [Tweetdeck][3] for the fresh content based on your keywords. Make a [research][4] on hashtags and stick to them.
* **Instagram** - always use hashtags, find relevant people and profiles and follow them, as well as their followers, comment on their pictures, be authentic in your comments and never use automated likes and responses.
* **Facebook** - tag relevant people and companies when sharing new content, post in thematic groups, use smart advertising setting up the needed demographic and preferences.
* **LinkedIn** - upload presentations, leaflets and visuals on SlideShare, post on Pulse, connect to stars in your industry, post in professional groups.
* Use automation for postingâ€‹ (**[Buffer or Hootsuite][5]**), find optimal time and post frequently.
* Make your own visuals: use **[Canva][6]**, **[Pixlr][7]** and **[Spark][8]** for fast and simple online design, free photo banks like **[Unsplash][9]**.

### **MONITOR!**

* **Almost all your actions online and offline must direct prospects on your website.**
* Always **test and measure the results **of your marketing campaigns. Growth hacking without analytics is like throwing pasta against the wall over and over again wondering which one is going to stick. If you test and measure it, though, you may see that the best-sticking pasta is fettuccine alla Bolognese.
* Use Google Analytics, KPIs on your social networks and automation tools. Search for new tools that would be relevant for your business.

### **KEEP GOING**

The impact of growth hacking is hard to measure in precise numbers because of the complexity of all the **moves** and **tricks** marketers use. We create the buzz, the talk around our businesses, glueing our logos into people's subconscious.

Being a growth hacker in a startup won't give you physical palpable results as often as you wish. But the warm feeling of satisfaction when a prospect exclaims **"Yes, I heard about you, folks!"** is definitely worth it.
