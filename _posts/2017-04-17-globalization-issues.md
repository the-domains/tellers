# **Globalization issues**

Experienced travelers know: you can always find wifi in McDonald's and Starbucks, wherever you are. They daily see the globalization everywhere they decide to start a new adventure. You can buy fresh burgers on each continent and your t-shirt looks exactly like a t-shirt from Brazil, India or Nigeria. 

Cultural globalization is the diffusion of commodities and ideas, reflects a standardization of [cultural][0] expressions around the world, says [James L. Watson][1], a professor of Anthropology at Harvard University.

Typical, all-the-same daily routine we all have - latte coffee at work, our fashion, uniform airport travel process, replica TV shows, sports that kids play in the yards globally, variety of cuisines one can try without any effort - it all creates so-called "global village" culture. 

We now seem to live in a borderless world - people easily understand each other by means of English, Internet makes all our connections fast and efficient, there are no boundaries for online shops delivery and we normally operate with three worldwide currencies: GBP, USD and EUR. Does it mean that our local culture is vanishing? 

As SUNY LEVIN Institute's project on Globalization says, many observers have stated that the homogenizing effect of globalization on national cultures in fact tends to produce a reaction among indigenous people, which leads to a desire to reaffirm their own local traditions. Author Benjamin Barber, in particular, has made the case that the sometimes-violent reactions against the West by elements within Islamic society may be seen in this light. Barber argues that these rebellious movements are seen as negative manifestations of a broader desire to re-indicate their traditional values, against the disruptive onslaught of Western beliefs. 

Discussing religion in terms of globalization can be very tricky as we see that Internet and media may have also contributed to the development of various beliefs. Sometimes faith can be "fashionable", "shareable". How can we define whether the global faith is genuine or spread due to the "demand"?

Globalization critic Jeremy Rifkin has suggested there may be a need to establish a World Cultural Organization to help represent diverse cultures and put cultural protection on an equal footing with the WTO. Another group, the International Network for Cultural Diversity, has made a similar argument for an institution to ensure that culture is being protected. 

As for me, I love culture, local culture in particular. When in a new country, I try to explore as much as I can about their habits and traditions, living costs and conditions, meals people usually eat, what music they listen to. It helps to get a better picture of the place you are exploring, yes, but it also makes you see how broad and ancient this given culture is.

Do I believe globalization is good and beneficial? Yes and no. Yes, because we are much more connected and have sometimes if not similar then very close standards and beliefs, which, you should agree, facilitate our business and personal communication. It is also good because people study more languages since everybody speaks at least English so you have to differ, and they have much broaden vision of entrepreneurial, travel and cultural world. 

And I do not like it because we all look, eat and have fun in the same manner. We become just global market items. Be sure to find a Taiwanese girl wearing the same H&M skirt you will be wearing somewhere in America, and next time ask your Swedish colleague whether he watched Pokémon cartoon in his childhood. Doesn't it make us feel copied?

This is why I will continue making Slavic braid hairstyle, eating borsch drinking vodka without caring about my diet: it is a part of my culture, famous worldwide; Japanese will continue producing sometimes creepy anime; Italians will worship pasta no matter where they are; Americans will be both oversized and super slim; Brazilians will carnival and play football as Premier League champions.

The process of globalization will be slow. I think, this is why local culture will survive and adapt, so there can be a symbiosis of traditions. McDonald's Italian/American/Ukrainian burger weeks and all those traditional salads are at least one of the proofs. I like these tendencies and the mix of countries that comes from this new broader world. It creates the feeling of connection with everyone yet reminds you of your roots, your homeland, your past.
