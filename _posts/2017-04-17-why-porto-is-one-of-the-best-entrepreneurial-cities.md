# **Why Porto is one of the best entrepreneurial cities?**

Indeed, how can a sunny, warm, wine city be stimulating and innovative in terms of business development? Well, usually you don't have many expectations about Porto before coming, this is why we guarantee you tons of unexpected discoveries.

We originally had the tickets to participate in **Porto Startup Weekend**, but the event got cancelled. Since the Portuguese are amazingly helpful and caring people (we will return to this topic later), one of the event organizers, Rui, prepared us an excursion to the **Porto Design Factory**. 

This school, collaborating with **Politécnico do Porto**, teaches soft skills, necessary to become a successful entrepreneur. There are bachelor and master programs, as well as projects aimed to develop solutions of different kinds. What is notable is their numerous collaborations with big corporations and the most important universities in the world. Portuguese government invests lots of money in business development, this is why there are plenty of opportunities for individuals with an entrepreneurial mindset. We had a chance to make a video tour to the PDF, stay tuned for the new post soon!

Visiting a place like PDF and seeing young folks happy to work in teams to resolve global issues inspires you just a lot, believe me. Actually, it may inspire you so much, that you will start thinking of moving to Portugal. And it is more than reasonable now.

**Firstly**, living is very cheap and easy to find (as we were told, €300-400 for one-room flat). Transportation is well coordinated and cheap - a single ticket is €1,2\. 

**Secondly**, Portugal is a country of big portions and small prices. You will definitely enjoy eating francesinha or divinely tasty sausages, drinking Super bock beer and Port wine and relaxing in cozy little pastelarias with sweet Pastel de Nata.

**Third** and my personal favorite is the sea. And not just sea, there are great waves, which means many surfing schools and very pleasant views. Also, the presence of seagulls all over the city creates nice summer vibe, even in March.

As we already said, there are many helpful people. Particularly, the whole country seemed to be curing my flu, starting with cough candies from a random woman on the station and finishing with homemade syrups made by our host. Another great thing is that you can survive without speaking Portuguese: if they don't speak some English, they will show you the way to the metro using sign language. Let's say that there are not so many places with people **as caring as in Portugal**.

Porto is a hidden gem that must be surely visited by young entrepreneurs and creatives. It gives you an inspiration burst. Even though the overall economic situation is not that good, optimistic Portuguese people will show you how to be happy in the present day.
