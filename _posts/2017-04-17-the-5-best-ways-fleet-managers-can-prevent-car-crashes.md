# The 5 best ways fleet managers can prevent car crashes

##### _One day, Tom, a **fleet manager** in a company with a fleet of 250 cars was wondering what he could do to improve safety of his fleet. His **drivers had been performing worse** comparing to the previous year and he couldn't see why._

##### _Are they driving faster, more aggressive? Are the traffic jams making **driving more dangerous**? Or, are drivers ...._

##### _Bzzz.. At this moment his phone vibrated. "New shoes available in your size" appeared on his screen..._

##### _...**more distracted**?! Suddenly he smiled. Following points came naturally and Tom drafted a plan to improve the safety of his fleet:_

### _**Education**_

##### To improve driver safety, education is mandatory. Firstly, educate yourself, read articles, books, follow trends. Then, talk to the drivers, organize seminars, workshops, introduce them to the news in technology and mobility world, conduct regular tests. Provide information about risks of **[distracted driving][0]**, fatigue, aggressiveness.

### _**Policies**_

##### Have Company policies that drivers sign with their working contract, update policies regularly and make sure to communicate the news to the employees. Conduct random safety checks and other safety related driver activities.

### _**Open data**_

##### Allow drivers to see their own performance, as well as company results. For instance, track their driving time and **[safety score][1]**. Make sure to respect their privacy and to communicate they are not "under surveillance".

### _**Social media**_

##### Nowadays, networks are a powerful tool of education, promotion and connectivity. Cooperate with Marketing department to show your company has strong safety culture and your drivers are road safety evangelists.

### _**Software**_

##### Technology eases implementation and improves the results of campaigns if done right. You choose: route video recording (**[Critical Event Video, Omnitrax][2]**), vehicle tracking (**[TomTom Telematics][3]**), distracted driving solutions (**[Freeedrive][4]**).
